# The Pinsky-Rinzel model

This is an implementation of the Pinsky-Rinzel model 
(see Pinsky and Rinzel 1994, 
[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00962717](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00962717)).
The code was used to produce some of the results presented
in Sætra et al. 2020: [An electrodiffusive, ion conserving Pinsky-Rinzel model with homeostatic mechanisms](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007661
).

## Installation 

Clone or download the repo, navigate to the top directory of the repo and enter the following
command in the terminal:
